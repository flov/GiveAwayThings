Welcome to GiveThingsAway
=========================

GiveThingsAway is a social network running on rails 2.3.8 which basically allows people to share their stuff with others.
Users are able to login easily via their facebook account and can then place things on the map which they want to give away.

For example
-----------

John has an old mini-disc player and he decides to buy an mp3 player. John needs to get rid of his mini-disc player. But what to do with it? Selling it on ebay for a Euro seems a bit ridiculous and a waste of time, so instead of throwing it to the garbage he decides to give it away for free so that somebody can still use it. 
So he signs up at GiveAwayThings.org with his Facebook account, enters his address and types "Mini-Disc Player Sony-XYZ3001" in the give away thing form.

Now anybody who is searching for a mini-disc plaer can contact him and arrange a meeting point to hand-over the mini-disc player.
